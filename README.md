# SignCast Front-End Project üìä

Welcome to the **SignCast** repository! This project aims to create a **PDF drawing tool** that helps installation teams design the installation of LED screens. The tool provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and downloading the installation diagram in PDF format.

## üìã Project Overview

SignCast is a React-based application designed to simplify the installation process of LED screens by offering a digital tool that allows users to:

- Select equipment from a pre-defined database (CSV).
- Toggle between configurations (e.g., screen orientation, installation type).
- Generate and download installation diagrams in PDF format.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the development and run the project locally, follow these steps:

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Node.js & npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
    - Install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Vite**: This project uses **Vite** as the build tool for fast and efficient development. 
	- Vite is already included as a development dependency and doesn't require global installation.

3. **Dependencies**: This project uses various libraries and frameworks:
    - **React** for building the UI.
    - **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
    - **Fabric.js** for drawing and generating PDF diagrams.
    - **Papaparse** for handling Excel (.xlsx) data.
    - **zustand** for state management.

### üìù Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fifolio/signcast.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd signcast
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Application Structure

The application is divided into the following main folders:

-   **components/**: Contains reusable UI components.
    -   **common/**: General components like the Navbar.
    -   **controllers/**: Handles major functional components like Configuration, Description, etc.
    -   **details/**: Displays the project information and equipment selection.
    -   **fabric/**: Includes the Fabric.tsx component for handling the diagram creation logic.
    -   **ui/**: Contains additional UI elements for the design.
    -   **upload/**: Handles file uploads, including Excel (.xlsx) file reading.
-   **helpers/**: Utility functions like file handling.
-   **stores/**: Zustand-based state management for user selections and configurations.
-   **public/**: Static assets like images or files.
-   **src/**: The main source directory for the React application.
-   **types/**: TypeScript types for defining application state and props.
## üîë Features

-   **Equipment Selection**: Users can select from dropdowns (e.g., LED Screen, Mount Type, Media Player).
-   **Dynamic Drawing**: Updates in real-time based on the selections, including screen orientation and installation type.
-   **PDF Export**: The application generates a downloadable PDF with the installation diagram.
-   **Configuration Options**: Users can adjust parameters like niche depth, screen size, and the distance from the floor to the screen center.

## üìÇ Folder Overview

-   **src/components/fabric/Fabric.tsx**: The main component responsible for drawing the diagram using Fabric.js.
-   **src/components/details/Notes.tsx**: Displays user notes and project information.
-   **src/components/controllers/Configuration.tsx**: Manages user configuration inputs for the screen and installation type.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Functionality

### 1. Equipment Selection üñ•Ô∏è

Users can choose different equipment such as LED screens, media players, and mount types from a pre-loaded Excel (.xlsx) file. This data is used to populate dropdown menus in the UI.

-   **CSV Parsing**: Uses the `Papaparse` library to read Excel (.xlsx) data.
-   **Dropdowns**: Built using Radix UI components like `@radix-ui/react-select`.

### 2. Drawing Display ‚úèÔ∏è

The **Fabric.tsx** component is the core of the drawing functionality. It leverages **Fabric.js** to render the LED screen diagram dynamically. Users can:

-   Toggle screen orientation (horizontal or vertical).
-   Adjust niche depth.
-   View the power outlet location and other measurements.

### 3. PDF Export üì•

Once the diagram is drawn and the user is satisfied with the configuration, they can download the drawing as a PDF.

-   Uses `@react-pdf/renderer` to generate and download the PDF.

## üìù Configuration Options

The application allows the following configurations:

-   **Orientation**: Toggle between horizontal and vertical screens.
-   **Installation Type**: Choose between recessed (Niche) or flat wall installation.
-   **Distance from Floor**: Input the distance from the floor to the center of the screen.
-   **Niche Depth**: Automatically calculated or adjusted by the user.

## üîÑ Data Flow

1.  **Excel (.xlsx) Data Loading**: The equipment data is loaded from a Excel (.xlsx) file and parsed using **Papaparse**.
2.  **User Selection**: User interactions (e.g., dropdown selections) update the **zustand** store, which triggers a re-render of the UI and the Fabric.js canvas.
3.  **Drawing Update**: The **Fabric.tsx** component listens for state changes and updates the drawing in real-time.
4.  **PDF Generation**: Once the drawing is complete, users can generate a PDF using the configured settings.

## üìä Excel File Format

For proper and successful loading of the Excel (.xlsx) file, make sure it includes the following header sections in each relevant sheet:

1. **Screen MFR sheet**:  
    - **Screen MFR**
    - **Make**
    - **Screen Size**
    - **Height**
    - **Width**
    - **Depth**

2. **Media Player MFR sheet**:  
    - **MFG. PART**
    - **Make**
    - **Height**
    - **Width**
    - **Depth**

3. **Mounts sheet**:  
    - **MFG. PART**
    - **Brand**
    - **Maximum Load (lbs)**

4. **Receptacle Box sheet**:  
    - **MFG. PART**
